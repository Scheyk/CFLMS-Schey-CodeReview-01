			<p class="headline">(CNN) â€” Police in two Florida counties are investigating the explosions of three ATMs in the past two months in the Tampa area, officials said. Two of the explosions occurred in Hillsborough County, according to Amanda Granit, a spokeswoman for the county sheriff's office. The first occurred December 22 at a Pilot Bank branch. Just after 3 a.m., a male suspect spray-painted the exterior video surveillance cameras, including the drive-up ATM camera, black.
